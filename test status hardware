Ublox-GPS PPS and time .ok  see software/hardware test               (2020/5/27)
        * PCB mod is neccesary wroom32d + DIO didn't free gpio 9,10
        * so GPS-TX was rewired to Rx0 (also needed for programming)
        * for programing te GPS module needs to be removed (temporary)
        * but esp-32 wroom 32d can be programmed in QIO
I2C         .......     ok see software/hardware test                (2020/5/28)
          with in module 2  DS3232-RTC 
          tested with SED1306 and H35B-I
          H35B-I has some ghost I2c adresses, but that 'll only 
          conflict with BME680.
          found: BME60,SED1306,H35B-I,24Lxx,DS2482,MCP23017,ADS1015
                 CCS811,HTS221,MCP4725,DS3232
          *PCB mod needed : RST of MCP23017 needs to be grounded
                            different adress selction for 2nd 24LXX
        
to be continued
